# Ideas

Seed Capsule that gives you all the starting stuff you need
 - mines a few minerals etc. Last 100 turns

## Robots
RoboMiner
Transport lines? Roads, monorail
###Robodigger
Put down animated vehicle. Tile replaced. Location saved (similar to construction). 
Tiles checks for connectivitey. Warning tile layer. 

## Surface
Hot lab. Might explode has to be far away
Food dome?
Telecoms. 10 tile radius communications.
Giant escape capsule where people live for a bit at start

## UG
Lab
Residence. Beautiful crystal tubes.
Red light district?
Manufacturing - consumer goods. pick what to make?
medical

## Layers/Colonies
Done:
Setting down a new seed creates new surface and underground tilelayers, and clickable sprite on seed
Selecting seed changes colony
selected = index of layer. Same for S and UG
class colony extends layer, has bool for S/UG
resources must be in array
func change_colony
func toggle_level

## Personal ideas
more asteroids?
Levels - Goals where you have 100 days to achieve
